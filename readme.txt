A very simple plugin that shows a thumbnail of a post's featured image when you are in the Posts/All Posts view mode.

== Description ==

This is a very simple (but useful) plugin. All it does is:

1. adds a "Featured Image" checkbox to the Screen Options when viewing in All Posts mode.
2. when the checkbox is selected, it will add a thumbnail of the post's Featured Image to the All Posts screen.

This allows you to:

1. easily take an inventory of posts to see which are missing featured images (in this day and age, all posts should have a featured image) and
2. quickly scan your postsâ€”it's frequently easier and quicker to identify a post by its featured image than by scanning titles.

No css or js is added. The database is not altered in any way.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ssm-xtra-post-info` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

In WordPress:

    Go to Plugins > Add New > search for :: SSM Xtra Post Info ::
    Press Install Now
    Press Activate Plugin
		
To install manually instead:

    Upload the ssm-xtra-post-info directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
    Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
